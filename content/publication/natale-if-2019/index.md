abstract: Software is usually studied in terms of the changes triggered by its operations
  in the material world. Yet to understand its social and cultural impact, one needs
  to examine also the different narratives that circulate about it. Software’s opacity,
  in fact, makes it prone to being translated into a plurality of narratives that
  help people make sense of its functioning and presence. Drawing from the case of
  Joseph Weizenbaum’s ELIZA, widely considered the first chatbot ever created, this
  article proposes a theoretical framework based on the concept of ‘biographies of
  media’ to illuminate the dynamics and implications of software’s discursive life.
  The case of ELIZA is particularly relevant in this regard because it became the
  centre of competing narratives, whose trajectories transcended the actual functioning
  of this programme and shaped key controversies about the implications of computing
  and artificial intelligence.
