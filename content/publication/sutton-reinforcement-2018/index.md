abstract: The significantly expanded and updated new edition of a widely used text
  on reinforcement learning, one of the most active research areas in artificial intelligence.Reinforcement
  learning, one of the most active research areas in artificial intelligence, is a
  computational approach to learning whereby an agent tries to maximize the total
  amount of reward it receives while interacting with a complex, uncertain environment.
  In Reinforcement Learning, Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto provide a clear and simple
  account of the field's key ideas and algorithms. This second edition has been significantly
  expanded and updated, presenting new topics and updating coverage of other topics.Like
  the first edition, this second edition focuses on core online learning algorithms,
  with the more mathematical material set off in shaded boxes. Part I covers as much
  of reinforcement learning as possible without going beyond the tabular case for
  which exact solutions can be found. Many algorithms presented in this part are new
  to the second edition, including UCB, Expected Sarsa, and Double Learning. Part
  II extends these ideas to function approximation, with new sections on such topics
  as artificial neural networks and the Fourier basis, and offers expanded treatment
  of off-policy learning and policy-gradient methods. Part III has new chapters on
  reinforcement learning's relationships to psychology and neuroscience, as well as
  an updated case-studies chapter including AlphaGo and AlphaGo Zero, Atari game playing,
  and IBM Watson's wagering strategy. The final chapter discusses the future societal
  impacts of reinforcement learning.
