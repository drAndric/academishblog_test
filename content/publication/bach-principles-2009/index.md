abstract: "From the Foreword:\\\"In this book Joscha Bach introduces Dietrich DÃ¶rner's\
  \ PSI architecture and Joscha's implementation of the MicroPSI architecture. These\
  \ architectures and their implementation have several lessons for other architectures\
  \ and models. Most notably, the PSI architecture includes drives and thusdirectly\
  \ addresses questions of emotional behavior. An architecture including drives helps\
  \ clarify how emotions could arise. It also changes the way that the architecture\
  \ works on a fundamental level, providing an architecture more suited for behaving\
  \ autonomously in a simulated world. PSI includesthree types of drives, physiological\
  \ (e.g., hunger), social (i.e., affiliation needs), and cognitive (i.e., reduction\
  \ of uncertainty and expression of competency). These drives routinely influence\
  \ goal formation and knowledge selection and application. The resulting architecture\
  \ generates new kindsof behaviors, including context dependent memories, socially\
  \ motivated behavior, and internally motivated task switching. This architecture\
  \ illustrates how emotions and physical drives can be included in an embodied cognitive\
  \ architecture.The PSI architecture, while including perceptual, motor, learning,\
  \ and cognitive processing components, also includes several novel knowledge representations:\
  \ temporal structures, spatial memories, and several new information processing\
  \ mechanisms and behaviors, including progress through types ofknowledge sources\
  \ when problem solving (the Rasmussen ladder), and knowledge-based hierarchical\
  \ active vision. These mechanisms and representations suggest ways for making other\
  \ architectures more realistic, more accurate, and easier to use.The architecture\
  \ is demonstrated in the Island simulated environment. While it may look like a\
  \ simple game, it was carefully designed to allow multiple tasks to be pursued and\
  \ provides ways to satisfy the multiple drives. It would be useful in its own right\
  \ for developing other architecturesinterested in multi-tasking, long-term learning,\
  \ social interaction, embodied architectures, and related aspects of behavior that\
  \ arise in a complex but tractable real-time environment.The resulting models are\
  \ not presented as validated cognitive models, but as theoretical explorations in\
  \ the space of architectures for generating behavior. The sweep of the architecture\
  \ can thus be larger-it presents a new cognitive architecture attempting to provide\
  \ a unified theory of cognition. It attempts to cover perhaps the largest number\
  \ of phenomena to date. This is not a typical cognitive modeling work, but one that\
  \ I believe that we can learn much from.\\\"--Frank E. Ritter, Series EditorAlthough\
  \ computational models of cognition have become very popular, these models are relatively\
  \ limited in their coverage of cognition-- they usually only emphasize problem solving\
  \ and reasoning, or treat perception and motivation as isolated modules. The first\
  \ architecture to cover cognition morebroadly is PSI theory, developed by Dietrich\
  \ Dorner. By integrating motivation and emotion with perception and reasoning, and\
  \ including grounded neuro-symbolic representations, PSI contributes significantly\
  \ to an integrated understanding of the mind. It provides a conceptual framework\
  \ thathighlights the relationships between perception and memory, language and mental\
  \ representation, reasoning and motivation, emotion and cognition, autonomy and\
  \ social behavior. It is, however, unfortunate that PSI's origin in psychology,\
  \ its methodology, and its lack of documentation have limited itsimpact. The proposed\
  \ book adapts Psi theory to cognitive science and artificial intelligence, by elucidating\
  \ both its theoretical and technical frameworks, and clarifying its contribution\
  \ to how we have come to understand cognition."
