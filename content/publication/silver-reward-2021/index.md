abstract: In this article we hypothesise that intelligence, and its associated abilities,
  can be understood as subserving the maximisation of reward. Accordingly, reward
  is enough to drive behaviour that exhibits abilities studied in natural and artificial
  intelligence, including knowledge, learning, perception, social intelligence, language,
  generalisation and imitation. This is in contrast to the view that specialised problem
  formulations are needed for each ability, based on other signals or objectives.
  Furthermore, we suggest that agents that learn through trial and error experience
  to maximise reward could learn behaviour that exhibits most if not all of these
  abilities, and therefore that powerful reinforcement learning agents could constitute
  a solution to artificial general intelligence.
