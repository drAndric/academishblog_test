abstract: The Handbook of Artificial Intelligence, Volume I focuses on the progress
  in artificial intelligence (AI) and its increasing applications, including parsing,
  grammars, and search methods. The book first elaborates on AI, AI handbook and literature,
  problem representation, search methods, and sample search programs. The text then
  ponders on representation of knowledge, including survey of representation techniques
  and representation schemes. The manuscript explores understanding natural languages,
  as well as machine translation, grammars, parsing, test generation, and natural
  language processing systems. The book also takes a look at understanding spoken
  language, including systems architecture and the ARPA SUR projects.  The text is
  a valuable source of information for computer science experts and researchers interested
  in pursuing further research in artificial intelligence
