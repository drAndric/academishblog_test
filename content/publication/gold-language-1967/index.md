abstract: 'Language learnability has been investigated. This refers to the following
  situation: A class of possible languages is specified, together with a method of
  presenting information to the learner about an unknown language, which is to be
  chosen from the class. The question is now asked, “Is the information sufficient
  to determine which of the possible languages is the unknown language?” Many definitions
  of learnability are possible, but only the following is considered here: Time is
  quantized and has a finite starting time. At each time the learner receives a unit
  of information and is to make a guess as to the identity of the unknown language
  on the basis of the information received so far. This process continues forever.
  The class of languages will be considered learnable with respect to the specified
  method of information presentation if there is an algorithm that the learner can
  use to make his guesses, the algorithm having the following property: Given any
  language of the class, there is some finite time after which the guesses will all
  be the same and they will be correct. In this preliminary investigation, a language
  is taken to be a set of strings on some finite alphabet. The alphabet is the same
  for all languages of the class. Several variations of each of the following two
  basic methods of information presentation are investigated: A text for a language
  generates the strings of the language in any order such that every string of the
  language occurs at least once. An informant for a language tells whether a string
  is in the language, and chooses the strings in some order such that every string
  occurs at least once. It was found that the class of context-sensitive languages
  is learnable from an informant, but that not even the class of regular languages
  is learnable from a text.'
