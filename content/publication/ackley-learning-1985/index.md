abstract: 'The computational power of massively parallel networks of simple processing
  elements resides in the communication bandwidth provided by the hardware connections
  between elements. These connections can allow a significant fraction of the knowledge
  of the system to be applied to an instance of a problem in a very short time. One
  kind of computation for which massively parallel networks appear to be well suited
  is large constraint satisfaction searches, but to use the connections efficiently
  two conditions must be met: First, a search technique that is suitable for parallel
  networks must be found. Second, there must be some way of choosing internal representations
  which allow the preexisting hardware connections to be used efficiently for encoding
  the constraints in the domain being searched. We describe a general parallel search
  method, based on statistical mechanics, and we show how it leads to a general learning
  rule for modifying the connection strengths so as to incorporate knowledge about
  a task domain in an efficient way. We describe some simple examples in which the
  learning algorithm creates internal representations that are demonstrably the most
  efficient way of using the preexisting connectivity structure.'
