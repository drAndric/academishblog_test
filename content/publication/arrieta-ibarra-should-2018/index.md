abstract: In the digital economy, user data is typically treated as capital created
  by corporations observing willing individuals. This neglects users' roles in creating
  data, reducing incentives for users, distributing the gains from the data economy
  unequally, and stoking fears of automation. Instead, treating data (at least partially)
  as labor could help resolve these issues and restore a functioning market for user
  contributions, but may run against the near-term interests of dominant data monopsonists
  who have benefited from data being treated as “free.” Countervailing power, in the
  form of competition, a data labor movement, and/or thoughtful regulation could help
  restore balance.
