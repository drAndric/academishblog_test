abstract: A general method, the tensor product representation, is defined for the
  connectionist representation of value/variable bindings. The technique is a formalization
  of the idea that a set of value/variable pairs can be represented by accumulating
  activity in a collection of units each of which computes the product of a feature
  of a variable and a feature of its value. The method allows the fully distributed
  representation of bindings and symbolic structures. Fully and partially localized
  special cases of the tensor product representation reduce to existing cases of connectionist
  representations of structured data. The representation rests on a principled analysis
  of structure; it saturates gracefully as larger structures are represented; it permits
  recursive construction of complex representations from simpler ones; it respects
  the independence of the capacities to generate and maintain multiple bindings in
  parallel; it extends naturally to continuous structures and continuous representational
  patterns; it permits values to also serve as variables; and it enables analysis
  of the interference of symbolic structures stored in associative memories. It has
  also served as the basis for working connectionist models of high-level cognitive
  tasks.
