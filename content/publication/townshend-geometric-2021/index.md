abstract: Machine learning solves RNA puzzles RNA molecules fold into complex three-dimensional
  shapes that are difficult to determine experimentally or predict computationally.
  Understanding these structures may aid in the discovery of drugs for currently untreatable
  diseases. Townshend et al. introduced a machine-learning method that significantly
  improves prediction of RNA structures (see the Perspective by Weeks). Most other
  recent advances in deep learning have required a tremendous amount of data for training.
  The fact that this method succeeds given very little training data suggests that
  related methods could address unsolved problems in many fields where data are scarce.
  Science, abe5650, this issue p. 1047; see also abk1971, p. 964 RNA molecules adopt
  three-dimensional structures that are critical to their function and of interest
  in drug discovery. Few RNA structures are known, however, and predicting them computationally
  has proven challenging. We introduce a machine learning approach that enables identification
  of accurate structural models without assumptions about their defining characteristics,
  despite being trained with only 18 known RNA structures. The resulting scoring function,
  the Atomic Rotationally Equivariant Scorer (ARES), substantially outperforms previous
  methods and consistently produces the best results in community-wide blind RNA structure
  prediction challenges. By learning effectively even from a small amount of data,
  our approach overcomes a major limitation of standard deep neural networks. Because
  it uses only atomic coordinates as inputs and incorporates no RNA-specific information,
  this approach is applicable to diverse problems in structural biology, chemistry,
  materials science, and beyond. A machine learning method significantly improves
  scoring of RNA structural models, despite being trained on very few structures.
