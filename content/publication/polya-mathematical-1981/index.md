abstract: "A unique, heuristic approach to mathematical discovery and problem solving\
  \ This combined edition of Mathematical Discovery: On Understanding, Learning and\
  \ Teaching Problem Solving is unique among mathematics texts. Espousing a heuristic\
  \ approach to mathematical problem solving, the text may be followed sequentially\
  \ or according to instructors' individualized curricula. Beginning with a discussion\
  \ of patterns and practical approaches to problem solving, the book then presents\
  \ examples from various branches of math and science to help students discover how\
  \ to solve problems on their own â€“ an invaluable skill for the classroom and beyond."
