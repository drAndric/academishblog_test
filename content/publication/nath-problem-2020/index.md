abstract: The advent of the intelligent robot has occupied a significant position
  in society over the past decades and has given rise to new issues in society. As
  we know, the primary aim of artificial intelligence or robotic research is not only
  to develop advanced programs to solve our problems but also to reproduce mental
  qualities in machines. The critical claim of artificial intelligence (AI) advocates
  is that there is no distinction between mind and machines and thus they argue that
  there are possibilities for machine ethics, just as human ethics. Unlike computer
  ethics, which has traditionally focused on ethical issues surrounding human use
  of machines, AI or machine ethics is concerned with the behaviour of machines towards
  human users and perhaps other machines as well, and the ethicality of these interactions.
  The ultimate goal of machine ethics, according to the AI scientists, is to create
  a machine that itself follows an ideal ethical principle or a set of principles;
  that is to say, it is guided by this principle or these principles in decisions
  it makes about possible courses of action it could takea. Thus, machine ethics task
  of ensuring ethical behaviour of an artificial agent. Although, there are many philosophical
  issues related to artificial intelligence, but our attempt in this paper is to discuss,
  first, whether ethics is the sort of thing that can be computed. Second, if we are
  ascribing mind to machines, it gives rise to ethical issues regarding machines.
  And if we are not drawing the difference between mind and machines, we are not only
  redefining specifically human mind but also the society as a whole. Having a mind
  is, among other things, having the capacity to make voluntary decisions and actions.
  The notion of mind is central to our ethical thinking, and this is because the human
  mind is self-conscious, and this is a property that machines lack, as yet.
