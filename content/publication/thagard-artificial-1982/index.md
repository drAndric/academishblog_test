abstract: 'Buchanan and Darden have provided compelling reasons why philosophers of
  science concerned with the nature of scientific discovery should be aware of current
  work in artificial intelligence. This paper contends that artificial intelligence
  is even more than a source of useful analogies for the philosophy of discovery:
  the two fields are linked by interfield connections between philosophy of science
  and cognitive psychology and between cognitive psychology and artificial intelligence.
  Because the philosophy of discovery must pay attention to the psychology of practicing
  scientists, and because current cognitive psychology adopts a computational view
  of mind with AI providing the richest models of how the mind works, the philosophy
  of discovery must also concern itself with AI models of mental operations. The relevance
  of the artificial intelligence notion of a frame to the philosophy of discovery
  is briefly discussed.'
